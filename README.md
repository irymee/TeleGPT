# GPT-Powered Chatbot ðŸ¤–
This bot is a chatbot powered by OpenAI's GPT-3.5-Turbo model. It generates responses to messages sent by users. Users have a limit on the number of responses they can receive per day, with paid users having a higher limit than free users. The bot uses a MongoDB database to keep track of user information and response counts. An admin can add paid users to the database.
